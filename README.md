# DesignPattern
## Description
This is a collection of known design patterns and some sample codes on how to implement them in Android. Every pattern has a small list of examples

## Run on Android studio
The current runtime environment is running in android studio, you just need to add the following to the .idea's gradle.xml in the labeled location

`<option name="delegatedBuild" value="false" />`

## Patterns
The patterns can be structured in roughly three different categories. Please click on the blue font to see the full explanation
